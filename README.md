## Guide Goals

This guide is our notes about our preferred way of installing Stable Diffusion.

This guide is intentionally step-by-step, because we want to help more people be successful, including people who are trying these kinds of software installs for the first time.

This guide is intentionally using steps that help multiple macOS users on the same system, because we want this guide to be able to help people who share a computer, such as teachers and students in schools.
